Crypto Ledger is an open-source website that allows users to track their cryptocurrency trades. It was written in Java and uses the Spring framework. It is currently deployed on Mogenius using a free tier account, which may lead to slow load times. Crypto Ledger uses a MySQL database. Due to hosting limitations, coin prices are stored in one large JSON file, which is then used to update price data.

~~The website is extended through the Crypto Ledger App, which makes use of the Rest API to allow users to manage their ledger.<br>The Crypto Ledger App can be found here: [Crypto Ledger App](https://github.com/TMDStudios/crypto_ledger_app_kotlin 'Crypto Ledger App')~~
